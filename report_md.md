## Alert Detail



### [ CSP: Wildcard Directive ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10055/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks. Including (but not limited to) Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

* URL: https://chefs-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/pr-966
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `content-security-policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `default-src 'none'`
  * Other Info: `The following directives either allow wildcard sources (or ancestors), are not defined, or are overly broadly defined: 
frame-ancestors, form-action

The directive(s): frame-ancestors, form-action are among the directives that do not fallback to default-src, missing/excluding them is the same as allowing anything.`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is properly configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

### [ Missing Anti-clickjacking Header ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10020/)



##### Medium (Medium)

### Description

The response does not include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options to protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks.

* URL: https://chefs-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/pr-966/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-frame-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 1

### Solution

Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.
If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.

### [ Proxy Disclosure ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/40025/)



##### Medium (Medium)

### Description

1 proxy server(s) were detected or fingerprinted. This information helps a potential attacker to determine 
 - A list of targets for an attack against the application.
 - Potential vulnerabilities on the proxy servers that service the application.
 - The presence or absence of any proxy-based components that might cause attacks against the application to be detected, prevented, or mitigated. 

* URL: https://chefs-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/pr-966
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: `TRACE, OPTIONS methods with 'Max-Forwards' header. TRACK method.`
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `Using the TRACE, OPTIONS, and TRACK methods, the following proxy servers have been identified between OWASP ZAP and the application/web server: 
- Unknown
The following web/application server has been identified: 
- [Express]
`
* URL: https://chefs-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/pr-966/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: `TRACE, OPTIONS methods with 'Max-Forwards' header. TRACK method.`
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `Using the TRACE, OPTIONS, and TRACK methods, the following proxy servers have been identified between OWASP ZAP and the application/web server: 
- Unknown
The following web/application server has been identified: 
- [Express]
`

Instances: 2

### Solution

Disable the 'TRACE' method on the proxy servers, as well as the origin web/application server.
Disable the 'OPTIONS' method on the proxy servers, as well as the origin web/application server, if it is not required for other purposes, such as 'CORS' (Cross Origin Resource Sharing).
Configure the web and application servers with custom error pages, to prevent 'fingerprintable' product-specific error pages being leaked to the user in the event of HTTP errors, such as 'TRACK' requests for non-existent pages.
Configure all proxies, application servers, and web servers to prevent disclosure of the technology and version information in the 'Server' and 'X-Powered-By' HTTP response headers.

#### Source ID: 1

### [ Cookie with SameSite Attribute None ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10054/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

A cookie has been set with its SameSite attribute set to "none", which means that the cookie can be sent as a result of a 'cross-site' request. The SameSite attribute is an effective counter measure to cross-site request forgery, cross-site script inclusion, and timing attacks.

* URL: https://chefs-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/pr-966
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `cf675f3b679ccb734cb7739a5b57a07c`

### [ Permissions Policy Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10063/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

Permissions Policy Header is an added layer of security that helps to restrict from unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources. This policy ensures the user privacy by limiting or specifying the features of the browsers can be used by the web resources. Permissions Policy provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to limit which features of browsers can be used by the page such as camera, microphone, location, full screen etc.

### [ Server Leaks Information via "X-Powered-By" HTTP Response Header Field(s) ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10037/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

The web/application server is leaking information via one or more "X-Powered-By" HTTP response headers. Access to such information may facilitate attackers identifying other frameworks/components your web application is reliant upon and the vulnerabilities such components may be subject to.

* URL: https://chefs-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/pr-966

### [ Strict-Transport-Security Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10035/)



##### Low (High)

### Description

HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism whereby a web server declares that complying user agents (such as a web browser) are to interact with it using only secure HTTPS connections (i.e. HTTP layered over TLS/SSL). HSTS is an IETF standards track protocol and is specified in RFC 6797.

### [ X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10021/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

* URL: https://chefs-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/pr-966/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-content-type-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type.
At "High" threshold this scan rule will not alert on client or server error responses.`

Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `no-store`
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 4

### Solution

The content may be marked as storable by ensuring that the following conditions are satisfied:
The request method must be understood by the cache and defined as being cacheable ("GET", "HEAD", and "POST" are currently defined as cacheable)
The response status code must be understood by the cache (one of the 1XX, 2XX, 3XX, 4XX, or 5XX response classes are generally understood)
The "no-store" cache directive must not appear in the request or response header fields
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "private" response directive must not appear in the response
For caching by "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, the "Authorization" header field must not appear in the request, unless the response explicitly allows it (using one of the "must-revalidate", "public", or "s-maxage" Cache-Control response directives)
In addition to the conditions above, at least one of the following conditions must also be satisfied by the response:
It must contain an "Expires" header field
It must contain a "max-age" response directive
For "shared" caches such as "proxy" caches, it must contain a "s-maxage" response directive
It must contain a "Cache Control Extension" that allows it to be cached
It must have a status code that is defined as cacheable by default (200, 203, 204, 206, 300, 301, 404, 405, 410, 414, 501).

### [ Re-examine Cache-control Directives ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10015/)



##### Informational (Low)

### Description

The cache-control header has not been set properly or is missing, allowing the browser and proxies to cache content. For static assets like css, js, or image files this might be intended, however, the resources should be reviewed to ensure that no sensitive content will be cached.

* URL: https://chefs-dev.apps.silver.devops.gov.bc.ca/pr-966/
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `cache-control`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `public, max-age=0`
  * Other Info: ``

Instances: 1

### Solution

For secure content, ensure the cache-control HTTP header is set with "no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate". If an asset should be cached consider setting the directives "public, max-age, immutable".
